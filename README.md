# SCRAG: Social Computing-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Community Response Forecasting

## Overview

SCRAG is a predictive framework designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical social media posts. It integrates large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques rooted in social computing. By retrieving historical responses and external knowledge, SCRAG generates diverse, realistic, and contextually grounded predictions of community reactions.

## Features

- Community-Aware Historical Response Retrieval: Captures ideological, semantic, and emotional aspects of past responses to inform predictions.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrates external knowledge from news sources and knowledge graphs to provide up-to-date context.
- Modular and Adaptable: Compatible with various embedding models and LLMs for flexibility.
- Comprehensive Evaluation: Tested across six real-world scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), demonstrating over 10% improvements in key evaluation metrics.
